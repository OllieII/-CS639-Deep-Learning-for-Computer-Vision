# -CS639-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision
This is a github repository is a record for the work me and my partner(Yibo Kong) have done in the CS639 in University of Wisconsin in Madison, in year 2024, which is well adapted from Stanford’s CS231n (CNNs for Visual Recognition) and Michigan’s EECS 498-007/598-005 (Deep Learning for Computer Vision).
